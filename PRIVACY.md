# Privacy Notice — User Friendly

This document describes the basic privacy practices for demo and deployed instances of User Friendly.

- Data collection: The demo app collects no personal data by default. Deployed installations may collect minimal contact information if you choose to provide it.
- Use of data: Contact or usage information provided for licensing or support will be used only to respond to your request.
- Third parties: We do not share personal data with third parties except as required by law.
- Contact: For questions about privacy, contact legal88customs at legal88customs@gmail.com.

This is a simple starter privacy notice. If you collect more data in the future (users, location, phone numbers) you must expand this document and follow applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
