# User Friendly — Simple Starter

This is a very simple demo and the core product code for User Friendly. The repository core is proprietary and is intended to remain private. To request licensing, demos, or partnerships, contact legal88customs at legal88customs@gmail.com.

How to open (beginner-friendly):
1. Download the three files (index.html, styles.css, app.js) into the same folder on your computer.
2. Open the file `index.html` by double-clicking it. Your browser will open the demo.
3. Click "Show Nearby Spotters" or "Show Resources" to see example data.

How to edit (two easy ways):
- On your computer:
  - Open the files with a text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or a free editor like VS Code).
  - Edit text and save, then refresh the browser to see changes.
- On GitHub (no installs needed):
  - Open a file in your repository on github.com and click the pencil icon (Edit this file).
  - Make changes, write a short message, and click "Commit changes".

Repository visibility: This repository will be made private to protect the source code. Contact legal88customs at legal88customs@gmail.com to request access or licensing.

Questions or help:
- If you want, tell me whether you'd like:
  - A web app (runs in a browser) — easiest to start with.
  - A mobile app (Android/iPhone) — needs extra setup on your computer.
- Tell me if you'd like me to add more features: a map, a form to add spotters, or a way to save contacts.

I can also create a Pull Request to add these starter files to your GitHub repo if you'd like — say "Please add these files to my repo" and confirm.
