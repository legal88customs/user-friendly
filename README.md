# User Friendly — Simple Starter

This is a very simple demo you can open with a web browser to get started.

How to open (beginner-friendly):
1. Download the three files (index.html, styles.css, app.js) into the same folder on your computer.
2. Open the file `index.html` by double-clicking it. Your browser will open the demo.
3. Click "Show Nearby Spotters" or "Show Resources" to see example data.

How to edit (two easy ways):
- On your computer:
  - Open the files with a text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or a free editor like VS Code).
  - Edit text and save, then refresh the browser to see changes.
- On GitHub (no installs needed):
  - Open a file in your repository on github.com and click the pencil icon (Edit this file).
  - Make changes, write a short message, and click "Commit changes".

Questions or help:
- If you want, tell me whether you'd like:
  - A web app (runs in a browser) — easiest to start with.
  - A mobile app (Android/iPhone) — needs extra setup on your computer.
- Tell me if you'd like me to add more features: a map, a form to add spotters, or a way to save contacts.

I can also create a Pull Request to add these starter files to your GitHub repo if you'd like — say "Please add these files to my repo" and confirm.
