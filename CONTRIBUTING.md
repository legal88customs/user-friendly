Welcome — thank you for wanting to help build this app!

If you're new to GitHub:
- You can edit files directly on the GitHub website using the pencil icon on any file page.
- To add a new file on GitHub:
  1. Go to your repo on github.com.
  2. Click "Add file" -> "Create new file".
  3. Enter the filename (for example index.html) and paste the contents.
  4. Scroll down, write a simple commit message (like "Add starter web demo") and click "Commit new file".

If you want me to add files for you:
- Say "Please add the starter files" and I will prepare the repo changes for you.

If you're comfortable editing locally later, I can guide you to install simple tools (VS Code) — but it's not required to begin.
